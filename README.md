# Multi-PC-Save-Manager
Copy saves between computers easily and quickly!

If you have multiple gaming PCs (or just need to sync saves) you can use this tool to upload and install saves from a flash drive.

Essentially:
Copies APPDATA from source PC (Will delete previous backup if it exists.)
Installs those on destination PC. (It only copies the saves of programs/games that are installed on both the source and destination PCs.)
