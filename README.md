# Multi-PC-Save-Manager
Copy saves between computers easily and quickly!

If you have multiple gaming PCs (or just need to sync saves) you can use this tool to upload and install saves from a flash drive.

# What Its Doing:
- Asks if you want to upload or install.
- [Upload] Copies APPDATA from source PC (Will delete previous backup if it exists.)
- [Install] Installs the files and folders that are on the flashdrive AND the destination PC. (If you have the same games/programs, they would save in the same structure.)

# Other Info
- Batch/CMD file (I'm dumb and it's good enough)
- It should be pretty quick (depends on the drive)
- Also, Chromium browsers have a really big APPDATA folder (mine was 1.5 gigs!) so keep that in mind.
